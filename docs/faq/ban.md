# Overcoming Bans

## What does the message "Leave XYZ to join the experience" mean?

![Ban 1](/images/faq/ban/group_ban_example.png)

When you receive the message **"Leave XYZ to join the experience"**, it means you have been banned from entering MYSverse. In this message, **"XYZ"** is the actual name of the Roblox group that is causing your ban.

### Important Terms

**Ban** - A restriction that prevents you from entering MYSverse

**Roblox Group** - A community in Roblox that you can join, usually with a name, badge, and members

**Blacklist** - A list of groups that have been banned by MYSverse

## Types of bans in MYSverse

There are two types of bans you may encounter:

### 1. Group ban

You are a member of a Roblox group that has been blacklisted by MYSverse. This is the most common type of ban experienced by players.

### 2. Individual ban

Your account has been specifically banned, usually for breaking the rules. This ban has a specific duration.

## Why am I banned even though I did nothing?

Most players facing this issue are actually under a **group ban**, not an individual ban. This means you are a member of a Roblox group that has been blacklisted by MYSverse for various reasons.

## How to resolve a group ban

**Correct solution: Leave the blacklisted Roblox group**

1. Go to your Roblox profile
2. Click on the "Communities" tab
3. Find the group mentioned in the ban message (replacing "XYZ")
4. Click "Leave Community" on that group
5. Try to rejoin the MYSverse experience after a few minutes

## How to check blacklisted groups

You can check the list of blacklisted groups through our **Sentral** platform:

**URL:** https://sentral.mysver.se/dashboard/mecs

Sentral is the official hub and companion app for MYSverse that provides game statistics, analytics tools, and information about blacklisted groups.

## Solutions that WILL NOT work

Do not try the following methods as they will not solve the problem:

- **Creating a new account** - The problem will persist if you are still in the same group
- **Just waiting** - Group bans will not disappear automatically
- **Changing your username** - This will not solve the group issue
- **Logging out and back into Roblox** - The ban is based on group membership, not session
- **Asking friends to "unban" you** - Just leave the problematic group

## Information about individual bans

If you are under an individual ban, the time displayed in the system is in **UTC time zone**.

**For players in Malaysia:** Add 8 hours to the displayed time to get Malaysia local time.

Example:

- If the system shows your ban will be lifted at 14:00 UTC
- The actual time in Malaysia is 22:00 (10:00 PM)

## Troubleshooting steps

### Step 1: Identify the type of ban

If the message mentions a specific group name (replacing "XYZ"), it is a group ban. If not, it may be an individual ban.

### Step 2: Check on the Sentral platform

Visit the Sentral dashboard and check the list of blacklisted groups to confirm which group is problematic.

### Step 3: Leave the problematic group

Go to the group's page on Roblox and click the "Leave Group" button. Make sure you have really left the group.

### Step 4: Try to rejoin

Wait a few minutes after leaving the group, then try to join MYSverse again.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I rejoin the group after playing?

Not recommended, as you will be banned again if the group is still blacklisted.

### What if I still can't join after leaving the group?

If you still have problems after leaving the blacklisted group, it may be an individual ban. Please contact the support team via Discord or our official platform.

### Why are certain groups blacklisted?

Groups are usually blacklisted because:

- Violating MYSverse community rules
- Involved in unwanted activities such as spam or harassment
- Related to bots or fake accounts
- Violating Roblox terms of service
- Promoting inappropriate content

### Where can I get further help?

If you need further assistance, please contact our moderators via [Discord MYSverse Moderation](https://discord.gg/n22p4CMHf4) or visit the full documentation on the official MYSverse website.
