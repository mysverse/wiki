# Settings & Customization in Lebuhraya

Lebuhraya offers several settings to customize your gameplay experience, optimize performance, and control your interactions.

## Accessing Settings

- Most general settings can be found in the **Main Menu**.
- Some specific toggles or options might be available through dedicated UI buttons on the game screen.

## Performance Settings

These settings can help improve performance, especially on less powerful devices.

- ### üåé Global Shadows Toggle

  - **Introduced:** v3.3.25

- ### üå≤ Tree Rendering Toggle

  - **Introduced:** v3.3.15
  - **Function:** Allows players to disable the rendering of trees. This can help reduce visual clutter and improve performance. Trees are also loaded in memory (not streamed) to potentially reduce crashes.
  - **Access:** Button on the top right corner of the Main Menu.

- ### ‚ú® Lighting Technology
  - **Change:** In v3.4.21, lighting technology was changed from "Future" to "ShadowMap" to improve performance on low-end devices. This is likely a global setting managed by the developers.

## Gameplay & Control Settings

  - **Function:** For Malaysian and Visitor teams, players can set their preferred spawn location between Putra Mahkota and Jersik.
  - **Access:** Main Menu.
  - **Update:** Default spawn set to Putra Mahkota consistently for these teams in v3.5.8, but the toggle likely remains.

- ### üì∑ MYS Module Camera Behaviour Customization

  - **Introduced:** v3.0.13
  - **Function:** Players can disable the default camera behavior in the MYS module (details of this behavior are not specified but likely refers to custom camera scripts).

- ### üîò Vehicle Collision Toggle
  - **Location:** On-screen button while in a vehicle.
  - **Function:** Allows toggling vehicle collisions.
  - **Visual Change (v3.0.13):** 'On' state color of the collision button changed from green to default black.
  - **Mobile UI (v3.0.6):** Resized collision button for better accessibility on the mobile driving interface.

## UI & Interface

- **New UI Font (v3.4.4):** The game adopted Roblox's "Builder Sans" font for text UI elements for increased clarity and readability.
- **Main Menu Access (v3.5.9):** Can now access the main menu through the topbar without needing to reset your character.
- **Mobile Driving Interface (v3.0.6):** Streamlined by resizing some buttons and removing the settings button from the bottom left while driving for a less cluttered view.
- **Gamepad Support (v3.3.27):** Ongoing improvements, including fixing main menu play buttons being unselectable with gamepads.

## Audio Settings

- **MyPod Personal Music Player (v3.0.11):** Access via the music icon on the top bar. Allows you to listen to a selection of music that only you can hear.
- **Siren Volume (v3.4.3):** Kesihatan ambulance siren volume was reduced. This indicates that some audio levels are managed globally by developers based on feedback.

## Developer & Admin Related

- **Overhead Rank GUI (v3.0.3):** Displays player display names instead of usernames. Also shows player levels.
- **Admin Chat Visibility (v3.3.4):** Adonis admins see full Roblox usernames instead of display names for easier moderation.

These settings provide a degree of control over your Lebuhraya experience. As the game updates, new options may become available. Always check the main menu and on-screen UI elements for the latest settings.
